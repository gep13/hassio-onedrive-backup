## v2.2 [October 2nd 2023]
Been a while, this is a pretty big release 🎉. Please make sure you read the Breaking Changes before upgrade.

### ❗Breaking 
* All configuration options have been moved from Home Assistant to the addon itself. The addon will attempt to migrate the old settings but if this fails, settings will be reverted to defaults! Make sure you go over all settings after upgrading.

### 🆕 Added  
* Generational Backups! You can now set backup retention policy to Generational (days, weeks, months, years). See README for full details.
* As mentioned above, all settings are now done through the Addon UI instead of Home Assistant. No need for restarting the addon when modifying settings.
* Ignore Allowed Hours for File Sync - Added option to allow File Syncing to occur all day and only have backups follow the Allowed Hours settings.
* Optional Telemetry - I've added an optional Opt-In option that sends anonymous configuration telemetry for which features are enabled to better help me focus on most used features. Full details in the README. (disabled by default)

### 🐞 Fixed
* File Sync Deletions - Fixed a bug where files synced would be deleted immediately after they were uploaded.
